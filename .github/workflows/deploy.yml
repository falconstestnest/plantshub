# Notes:
# - This workflow assumes your build command is `npm run build` and the build output is in `dist/`.
# - If your build output is in `build/` or another folder, change `publish_dir` accordingly.
# - If you use Vite, ensure your vite.config has `base: '/plantshub/'` so asset paths work under GitHub Pages.
